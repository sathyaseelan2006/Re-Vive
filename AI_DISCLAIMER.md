AI Content & Disclaimer

The Re:Vive platform uses generative AI services to produce explanatory text and narrated content. While the system is tuned to provide accurate, historically-grounded responses, the following should be noted:

- AI-generated content may occasionally contain inaccuracies or oversimplifications.
- For scholarly or citation-critical use, consult primary sources and expert literature (links to ASI, UNESCO, Britannica are provided where available).
- The chatbot adopts an expert persona for educational framing; responses are not a substitute for professional archaeological or conservation advice.

Users are advised to verify critical facts from authoritative sources before relying on the content for research or publication.
